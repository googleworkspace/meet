# Hello, World: The Add-on

This is approximately the simplest possible add-on. The only requirements to get started here are npm and GitHub. The intent of publishing this add-on is to demonstrate how easy it is to get started with rendering custom content using an add-on. Please see other samples at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples> to learn more advanced functionality!
