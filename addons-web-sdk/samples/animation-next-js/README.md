# Pretty Colors: Next JS Add-on

This is a Meet Add-on built in Next JS. This add-on displays an animation that is intended to create a simple "shimmer" effect based on the color that each call participant selects. This add-on only exists to show more features of Google Meet Add-ons than can be found at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples/hello-world-next-js>. If you find anything about the configuration confusing, please see that more basic example.

You can view a deployed version of this Add-on at <https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/animation-next-js/sidepanel> and its corresponding [mainstage.html](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/animation-next-js/mainstage).
