# React TypeScript example

This "hello, world!" add-on is built using React, TypeScript, and [Vite](https://vite.dev/) in order to show how a React app can be deployed as a static site to be used as an add-on. It is very similar to the sample at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples/hello-world>, but the basic structure is a multi-page React app. Please see our other [samples](https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples) to learn more advanced functionality!

This add-on is deployed with GitHub pages, so that you can view the live versions of its [Side Panel](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-react-ts-vite/sidepanel) and [Main Stage](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-react-ts-vite/mainstage).
