# React TypeScript example

This "hello, world!" add-on is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite in order to show how a React app can be modified to work as an add-on. It is very similar to the sample at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples/hello-world>, but the basic structure is a multi-page React app. Please see other samples at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples> to learn more advanced functionality!

You can view a deployed version of this Add-on at <https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-react-ts-vite/SidePanel.html> and its corresponding [MainStage.html](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-react-ts-vite/MainStage.html).
