# React TypeScript example

This "hello, world!" add-on is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to show how an Add-on can be deployed as a static site using React and TypeScript. It is very similar to the sample at [googleworkspace/meet/addons-web-sdk/samples/hello-world](https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples/hello-world), but the basic structure is a multi-page React app using Next.js's app routing. Please see our other [samples](https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples) to learn more advanced functionality!

This add-on is deployed with GitHub pages, so that you can view the live versions of its [Side Panel](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-next-js/sidepanel) and [Main Stage](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-next-js/mainstage).
