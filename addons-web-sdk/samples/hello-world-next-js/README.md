# React TypeScript example

This "hello, world!" add-on is built using Next JS to show how an Add-on can be deployed as a static site using React and TypeScript. It is very similar to the sample at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples/hello-world>, but the basic structure is a multi-page React app using NextJS's app routing. Please see other samples at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples> to learn more advanced functionality!

You can view a deployed version of this Add-on at <https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-next-js/sidepanel> and its corresponding [mainstage](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world-next-js/mainstage).
