# Hello, World: The Add-on

This is approximately the simplest possible Meet add-on. The only requirements to get started here are npm and GitHub. The intent of publishing this add-on is to demonstrate how easy it is to get started with rendering custom content using an add-on. Please see other samples at <https://github.com/googleworkspace/meet/tree/main/addons-web-sdk/samples> to learn more advanced functionality!

You can view a deployed version of this Add-on at <https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world/SidePanel.html> and its corresponding [MainStage.html](https://googleworkspace.github.io/meet/hello-world/MainStage.html).
